# DegreeAudit


  The motivation behind this project is to provide a solution to the advising problem for computer science students. As the number of students grows so does the need to organize the information related to each student. Our project aims to provide a solution to this problem by providing students and advisors with a system that collects and provides the advisor with this information. The Goal of this project was to first provide a system to manage advising sessions and release the students' hold.

  The tracking and updating of a students degree progression is another feature that we wanted to implement. Basically, an alternative to Degree Works. We want students to be able to update which courses they’ve taken, and subsequently, seeing the progression in their degree plan. This will require Administrators to create and manage courses(and their categories), degree plans, pre-requisites, and so own. Our database is designed with all of this in mind.
  
  The project was broken down into two main components, the api and the frontend. This was done so that the project was not limited to one website or one mobile app. The implementation with an api allowed for any developer working on this project to use the framework they are most comfortable with and allowed for variety for the end user. This way users can install the app if they want more features than just a browser but are not limited to a mobile app if they don’t want to install one.
